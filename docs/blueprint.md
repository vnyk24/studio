## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Red (#8B0000) to mirror Netflix's brand, providing a familiar and engaging experience.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) creating a cinematic feel and minimizing distractions.
- Accent color: Light grey-red (#CD5C5C) for interactive elements like buttons and active status indicators, contrasting with the dark background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Minimalist white icons for play, pause, volume, and other controls. Consider using icons that subtly echo the Netflix aesthetic.
- Layout should mimic Netflix. A clean, intuitive grid layout with video screen prominently displayed and chat/user panels on the sides.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for user interactions, like sliding panels for chat or expanding video controls on hover.
